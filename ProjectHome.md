XProfile is a spin-off project from [Enterprise Social Network](http://code.google.com/p/esn/). The wiki page [Profile Metadata](http://code.google.com/p/esn/wiki/Profile_Metadata) defines the starting idea behind XProfile.

XProfile presents an extensible (and exhaustive) XML schema based metadata defining a _candidate profile_. XML instances of this schema will provide a comprehensive profile information, which can be used to generate targeted curriculum vitaes or resumes.

XProfile will also contain a set of desktop as well as server-side tools, such as those for the creation of XML profiles and generation of curriculum vitaes according to any template. Such tools can be used by end-users to generate their own profiles as well as by recruiters, recruitment agencies and employers to effectively simplify interoperability of profile metadata information.
